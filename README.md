# n00bz
n00bz is a platform that helps non-technical founders get cheap prototypes built, and helps new developers cut their
teeth solving real problems. 

## Purpose 

>Only after shipping and attempting to sell the product would a startup hear any substantive feedback from customers. And too often, after months or even years of development, entrepreneurs learned the hard way that customers were not buying their product because they did not need or want most of its features.

-Steve Blank 

### For non-technical founders

To this day I see non-technical founders spend a bunch of money overbuilding an app only to have it fall totally flat. The truth is that founders (even experienced founders) rarely nail it on the first iteration. Non-technical founders need to be able to play with ideas, prototype, and learn. What they don't need is a professional software developer to help them do that. Why? Because you don't need an F1 mechanic to help you change a tire. n00bz is a platform to help non-technical founders design requirements for and build cheap prototypes of their app ideas. They can use it to prove (or more likey disprove) their underline hypotheses about their apps.

### For new developers 

If you are in the population of up and coming software developers (you can hack something together, but you aren't ready for the job market) then instead of doing yet another tutorial, you can build a prototype, solve a real problem, and get a stipend in return.
